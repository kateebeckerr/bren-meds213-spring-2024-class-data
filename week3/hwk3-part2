-- Part 1
SELECT Site_name, MAX(Area)
FROM SiteGROUP BY Site_name;
-- the code above is conceptually flawed because
    -- the site table has multiple rows with the same Site_name so the query will not conduct accurate averaging without proper grouping
    -- there are multiple rows with the maximum Area it may not be associated with the correct site_name

SELECT * FROM Site;
SELECT Site_name, AVG(Area) FROM Site

SELECT Site_name, AVG(Area) FROM Site;
SELECT Site_name, COUNT(*) FROM Site;
SELECT Site_name, SUM(Area) FROM Site;

-- Part 2
SELECT * FROM Site;
SELECT Site_name, Area
FROM Site
ORDER BY Area DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- PART 3 Query
SELECT Site_name, Area FROM Site WHERE Area = (SELECT MAX(Area) FROM Site);
